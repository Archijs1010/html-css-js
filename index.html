        <p >
            Programming, or computer coding, is the process of creating a set of instructions, <br>
            called a program, for a computer to follow to perform tasks. Programmers write code in <br>
            a specific language (like Python or JavaScript) to design, build, test, and maintain software, <br>
            applications, and systems that solve problems and enable technology.
